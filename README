Vapour Liquid Equilibrium using Java
----------------------------------
Ver 0.1


* What is it?
  -----------

VLE is a program written in java to simulate the thermodynamic systems
containing liquid and vapour. It can determine various system properties
like bubble point, dew point, etc. It is designed to be cross-platform
compatible and extendable.

Checkout VLE homepage at http://vle-java.sourceforge.net



* Features
  --------

- Written in pure java and should run on platforms supported by java.

- Supports BUBL P, BUBL T, DEW P, DEW T, Flash point, Pxy diagrams and
  Txy diagrams.

- Various methods for calculations available:
    o Margule's equations and VanLaar equations for activity coefficient
      calculations.
    o Virial equation and Redlich-Kwong equation for fugacity coefficient
      calculations.
    o Adding user defined methods for calculations is possible. Just
      implement the proper interface and add the class name to appropriate
      properties file. As simple as that.

- Localization support. Resource bundles are used, and anyone can
  easily localize the application without the need of recompile. Just
  make sure that the properties files are UTF-8 encoded.


* To Do
  -----

- NRTL, UNIQUAC, UNIFAC methods will be added for activity calculations.

- Peng-Robinson equation will be added for fugacity calculations.

- Ensure proper translation of the application in Japanese language.
